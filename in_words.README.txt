# A single word (or phrase if supported by the API) is allowed per line:
#	Words are processed in order and their order is retained in the output file
# 	Additionally, any whitespace is ignored

# Example:
## - Bodily fluids -
sanguine
    choleric
		bilious

phlegmatic

# Words can be prefixed with _ to 'dismiss' them and move them to the end of the output file, for example:
_desiccate
ephemeral

# In this example 'desiccate' will appear after 'ephemeral' in the 'dismissed words' section of the output file
